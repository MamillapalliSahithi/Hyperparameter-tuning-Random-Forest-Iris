# Hyperparameter-tuning-Random-Forest-Iris
This Python script demonstrates the process of building and optimizing a Random Forest classifier using the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The script starts by importing necessary libraries, including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The Iris dataset is loaded, and the data is prepared for analysis by creating a DataFrame that includes the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the target species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. A Random Forest classifier is initialized, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters, such as the number of estimators, maximum depth of trees, and minimum samples required for splitting nodes.

After identifying the best hyperparameters, the model is trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the test set. The script evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy, generating a classification report, and visualizing the confusion matrix using a heatmap. Additionally, the script calculates and visualizes feature importances, showing the relative importance of each feature in making predictions. The feature importance plot helps to understand which features contribute most to the model's decisions, providing insights into the underlying patterns in the data. Overall, the script offers a comprehensive approach to building, tuning, and evaluating a Random Forest classifier for a multi-class classification problem using the Iris dataset.
